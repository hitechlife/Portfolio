This repository contains a few of my past works:

- *DiscoverStem.apk* is an Android app I released (which is available on the Play Store) that provides information on various careers in STEM, including job prospects and pay. More info available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stemhi5.discoverstem

- *Sherclock* is a video game made with Unity 2D and C#. It is meant to teach the benefits of using a password manager. I worked with Carnegie Mellon University CyLab and Giada Sun on this project. It is available for Windows in a zip file.

- *Adventures at CMU* is a short video game I created with Unity with a team at my school for the hackathon HackCMU in 2017. Use the arrow keys to move and explore the different areas. There are build settings for both Windows and Mac (for Windows, make sure to unzip the folder and run the .exe file)

- I also contributed to another Unity game titled *Gardenlight* with a team at CMU. It is visible at the following repository: https://github.com/lightgarden/Gardenlight 

- In addition to the previously stated projects, I have also worked on a Unity video game project (not yet released) that is a 2D Platformer produced by *YouMatter Studios*. A playable beta version is available here: https://github.com/frahma7/YouMatterStudiosProjectEwo

Thank you for viewing.
