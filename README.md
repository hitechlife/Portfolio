This repository contains a few of my past works:

--DiscoverStem.apk is an Android app I released (which is available on the Play Store) that provides information on various careers in STEM, including job prospects and pay. More info available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stemhi5.discoverstem

--Adventures at CMU is a short video game I created with Unity with a team at my school for the hackathon HackCMU in 2017. Use the arrow keys to move and explore the different areas.

--Level1 is part of another Unity game I created at my time with YouMatter Studios. This level was the tutorial level but I contributed to aspects like the swing and enemy patrol.

Thank you for viewing.
